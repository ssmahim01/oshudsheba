              The online store of equipment and electronics is one of the leading
              online stores. The band was released in 25 volumes. During this
              time, our team sent 228 cypemapkets and managed to create a
              powerful, fast-working online store. The range of online supply
              points is huge and covers all company categories available for
              convenience stores.

              In 2019, we presented a new border policy strategy that covers all
              aspects of the company's activities – corporate style, delivery, and
              consultant work.
